My Goals:

1 : figure out how to use a webcam from the command line on ubuntu 20.4.
then determine if a webcam is installed on this host computer.
2 : if a webcam is installed use the command line to take a picture and save
it. do not delete the image. do not use a graphical user interface.
3 : figure out how to upload the image file to imgur.com from command line.
Try a bash script. this is the imgur default client id.
4 : upload image to imgur.com and append the goals.txt file with the url.
